/*

You are given an array of CPU tasks, each represented by letters A to Z, and a cooling time, n.
Each cycle or interval allows the completion of one task.
Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint:
identical tasks must be separated by at least n intervals due to cooling time.
â€‹Return the minimum number of intervals required to complete all tasks.

Example 1:
Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.
After completing task A, you must wait two cycles before doing A again.
The same applies to task B. In the 3rd interval, neither A nor B can be done, so you idle.
By the 4th cycle, you can do A again as 2 intervals have passed.

Example 2:
Input: tasks = ["A","C","A","B","D","B"], n = 1
Output: 6
Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> C -> D -> A -> B.
With a cooling interval of 1, you can repeat a task after just one other task.

Example 3:
Input: tasks = ["A","A","A", "B","B","B"], n = 3
Output: 10
Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B.
There are only two types of tasks, A and B, which need to be separated by 3 intervals.
This leads to idling twice between repetitions of these tasks.

Constraints:
1 <= tasks.length <= 104
tasks[i] is an uppercase English letter.
0 <= n <= 100
